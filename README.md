This project is a dynamic and interactive React.js dashboard located on the home page, complete with drag-and-drop functionality. Users can add, edit, resize, and rearrange widgets like stat boxes, line charts, and geography charts. A side navigation bar allows seamless navigation to other components, some of which are displayed directly on the dashboard. 

It also features a modal for editing widget details, making customization intuitive and user-friendly. The project meets most requirements, delivering a responsive and engaging user experience, with room for further refinement.
